//section 11: EVENTS in JavaScript

//HTML events are "things" that happen to html elements.
//When JavaScript is used in HTML pages, JAvaScript can "react" on these events.

// ➡️ HTML Events:
// An HTML event can be something the browser does, or something a user does.
// Here are some examples of HTML events:

// 1) An HTML web page has finished loading
// 2) An HTML input field was changed
// 3) An HTML button was clicked
// 4) often, when events happen, you may want to do something.

//JavaScript lets you execute code when events are detected.
//HTML allows event handler attributes, with JavaScript code, to be added to HTML elements.

// section 1️⃣ 4 ways of writing Events in JavaScript.

// 1: using inline events alert();
// 2: By calling a function (We already seen and most common way of writting)
// 3: using Inline Events (HTML onclick=" " property and element.onclick)
// 4: using Event Listeners (addEventListener and IE's attachEvent)
