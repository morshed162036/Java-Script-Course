//Section-10: Document object model in javascript.

// window is the main container or we can say the global Object 
// and any operations related to entire browser window can be a
// part of window object.

//for exp: the history or to find the url etc.

// 1️⃣ whereas the DOM is the child of window object.

// 2️⃣ All the members like objects, methods or properties.
// if they are the part of window object then we do not refer the window object.
// Since window is the global object so you do not have to write down window.
// - it will be figured out by the runtime.
